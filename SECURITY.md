# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since this project has not yet matured to version 1.0.0, security updates will
be addressed and fixed on the master branch, resulting in a new Python package
release which will of course be pushed to Pypi.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue in the project while it has not yet matured to
version 1.0.0, please raise a GitHub issue. I will try to address security
issues ASAP.
